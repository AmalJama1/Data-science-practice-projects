# Data Science Practice Projects

Hi there! I'm Amal Jama, a 3rd-year Financial Engineering student exploring the world of data science, finance, and machine learning.

Join me as I apply what I learn in class to build market-driven solution  using real-world data. This space is where I practice, experiment, and grow through hands-on projects.

## ðŸš€ First Project: Asset Pricing

Iâ€™ll begin this journey by working on an Asset Pricing project analyzing a stock's value using models like GBM and visualizing market behavior using historical data.

Stay tuned as I test different models, learn new tools, and share my insights along the way.
